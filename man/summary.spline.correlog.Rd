\title{Summarizing spline correlograms}
\usage{
\method{summary}{spline.correlog}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class "spline.correlog", usually, as a result of a call to \code{\link{spline.correlog}}.}

\item{\dots}{other arguments}
}
\value{
A list summarizing spline correlograms is returned. 
\item{estimates}{a vector of benchmark statistics:}
\item{$x}{is the lowest value at which the function is = 0. If correlation is initially negative, the distance calculated appears as a negative measure.}
\item{$e}{is the lowest value at which the function is <= 1/e.}
\item{$y}{is the extrapolated value at x=0.} 
\item{quantiles}{a matrix summarizing the quantiles in the bootstrap (or null) distributions of the benchmark statistics.}
