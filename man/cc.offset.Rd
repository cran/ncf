\title{Function to calculate the distance at which the cross-correlation peaks for Sncf objects}
\usage{
cc.offset(object, xmax = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class "Sncf2D", usually, as a result of a call to \code{Sncf2D} or \code{spline.correlog2D}.}

\item{xmax}{the maximum distance to consider (default is no upper limit).}
}
\value{
An matrix of class "cc.offset" is returned with columns:
\item{angle}{the cardinal angle (in degrees).}
\item{distance}{the distances (in the positive direction) to the mode of the (cross-) correlation function (with 95\% confidence bounds).}
\item{correlation}{the correlation at the mode (with CI) for each of the cardinal angles.}
}
\description{
Alternative `summary' method for class "Sncf2D".
